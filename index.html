                        In collaboration with Taylor Bell and NASA Ames, I contributed to the development of the Eureka!
                        analysis pipeline. Eureka! is a data reduction and analysis tool specifically designed for
                        exoplanet time-series observations, with a particular emphasis on JWST data. Over the next 1-2
                        decades, JWST will focus on four main science themes: the Early Universe, Galaxies Over Time,
                        the Star Lifecycle, and Other Worlds. Eureka! aims to provide the astronomy community with an
                        open-source end-to-end pipeline tool for the reduction and analysis of exoplanet time-series
                        observations, supporting the pursuit of the fourth theme, Other Worlds. This work was presented

                    <div class="tile-description">
                        Abstract: Interactions between exoplanetary atmospheres and internal properties have long
                        been hypothesized to be drivers of the inflation mechanisms of gaseous planets and apparent
                        atmospheric chemical disequilibrium conditions1. However, transmission spectra of exoplanets has
                        been limited in its ability to observational confirm these theories due to the limited
                        wavelength coverage of HST and inferences of single molecules, mostly H2O (ref. 2). In this
                        work, we present the panchromatic transmission spectrum of the approximately 750 K, low-density,
                        Neptune-sized exoplanet WASP-107b using a combination of HST WFC3, JWST NIRCam and MIRI. From
                        this spectrum, we detect spectroscopic features due to H2O (21σ), CH4 (5σ), CO (7σ), CO2 (29σ),
                        SO2 (9σ), and NH3 (6σ). The presence of these molecules enable constraints on the atmospheric
                        metal enrichment (M/H is 10–18× Solar3), vertical mixing strength (log10Kzz = 8.4–9.0 cm2s−1),
                        and internal temperature (>345 K). The high internal temperature is suggestive of tidally-driven
                        inflation4 acting upon a Neptunelike internal structure, which can naturally explain the
                        planet’s large radius and low density. These findings suggest that eccentricity driven tidal
                        heating is a critical process governing atmospheric chemistry and interior structure inferences
                        for a majority of the cool (1,000K) super-Earth-to-Saturn mass exoplanet population.

                        Abstract: Emission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres give clues about their temperature
                        structure, composition, vertical transport and geometric albedo, elucidating their chemical
                        processes and giving clues about their formation and aerosols. We reveal the JWST 2-11 um
                        emission spectrum of the hot Saturn WASP-69 b (960 K zero-albedo equilibrium temperature) over
                        three eclipses as part of the MANATEE program. We find evidence for carbon dioxide, carbon
                        monoxide and water vapor in the atmosphere. The features are seen in absorption and require a
                        temperature profile that decreases with altitude. Chemical equilibrium models point to an
                        atmosphere enriched in heavy elements relative to its host star. We also find an unexpectedly
                        high planet-to-star flux ratio at the shortest wavelengths (below 3 um), indicating a possible
                        high geometric albedo for the planet, but one that is hard to reconcile with the thermal
                        emission of the planet. This spectrum opens a new window into hot Jupiter atmospheres in the
                        sub-1000 K equilibrium temperature regime where chemical transitions are expected to be
                        significant.

                        Abstract: We report Very Large Array observations in the Q band toward 10 ionized jet candidates
                        to search for SiO emission, a well-known shocked gas tracer. We detected 7 mm continuum
                        counterparts toward 90% of the jet candidates. In most cases, the jet candidate is located
                        toward the center of the 7 mm core, and the high masses (≈100 M⊙) and densities (≈107 cm−3) of
                        the cores suggest that the central objects are very young high-mass protostars. We detected SiO
                        J = 1–0 emission associated with six target sources. In all cases, the morphology and spectrum
                        of the emission is consistent with what is expected for molecular jets along an outflow axis,
                        thus confirming the jet nature of 60% of our sample. Our data suggest a positive correlation
                        between the SiO luminosity LSiO, and both the bolometric luminosity LBol and the radio
                        luminosity Sνd2 of the driving sources.

                        Abstract: Even though high-mass stars (M>8 Msun) shape the universe at all scales, from their
                        ionizing winds to their explosive deaths, how they are formed is still one of the biggest
                        unknowns in astronomy. One proposed formation model is a scaled up version of the accretion
                        model that seems to work well for lower mass objects. Jets are key ingredients in this formation
                        scenario, since they dissipate excess angular momentum and allow accretion to proceed. However,
                        observing massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) in their earliest protostellar stages is to this
                        day a challenge. Due to the large distances and short time scales involved, the number of known
                        ionized jets driven by MYSOs is scarce, making the comparison of theoretical models with
                        observations a difficult task. Using high resolution VLA cm observations, we have found a large
                        set of jet candidates driven by very early MYSOs. Most of these candidates are unresolved and
                        other probes are needed to confirm their jet nature. SiO is a well-known molecular jet tracer,
                        since its abundance is highly enhanced in shocked gas regions due to the sputtering of dust
                        grains. To confirm the jet nature of the emission, we carried out VLA observations toward a
                        sample of 10 ionized jet candidates at 42 GHz looking for SiO J=1-0 emission. In this talk we
                        will present the preliminary results of this work.

                    <div class="tile-description">
                        Abstract: Rakov and Uman pointed out (Lightning: Physics and Effects, 2003) that despite 5000
                        published reports of ball lightning (BL) and a scientific literature comparable in volume to the
                        literature on conventional lightning, we still have no idea of what mechanisms create or power
                        BL. Lightning characterization technology advances can and should be applied to BL studies. Keul
                        and Diendorfer (2018) have correlated BL reports with European lightning-detection network data,
                        but no such attempt has been made for US BL reports up to now. Using 31 BL reports from a
                        now-defunct US website, we have attempted correlations with National Lightning Detection Network
                        (NLDN) and radar data archived at the National Climactic Data Center. Of the 31 reports, 5
                        objects were indoors and 25 were reported to coincide with thunderstorms. Time information
                        accurate to 30 minutes (1 sigma) and location information accurate within one to ten km was
                        available from nine of the reports, and for these we obtained both NLDN and composite radar data
                        covering the time frames indicated by the reports. For three of the nine reports, we found NLDN
                        located strikes plausibly within the distance and time frames of the observer reports – thus
                        qualifying as nearby (possibly causal) lightning. However, for the report for which the location
                        of the ball was known within meters, the nearest lightning was 2.3 km away. 23 reports only
                        associate BL with a storm within 25 km. Should it continue to hold in the face of more evidence,
                        the relative lack of correlation of BL and nearby lightning suggests that the production of BL
                        is associated more with static or changing electric fields in the vicinity of thunderstorms,
                        than with the lightning plasma channel itself. While these results by themselves are limited, we
                        are optimistic that one can learn more about the link between natural and ball lightning by
                        fusing more precise eyewitness reports with lightning location and other archival meteorological
                        data. To this end, we have launched a website to guide citizen scientists in future ball
                        lightning reports. The site may be reached via https://tinyurl.com/BLReport.
